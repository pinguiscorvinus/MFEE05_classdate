         <p>The House of Habsburg (/ˈhæpsbɜːrɡ/; German: [ˈhaːpsbʊʁk]; alternatively spelled Hapsburg in English) and also officially called the House of Austria (Haus Österreich in German, Casa de Austria in Spanish),[1] was one of the most influential and distinguished royal houses of Europe. The throne of the Holy Roman Empire was continuously occupied by the Habsburgs from 1438 until their extinction in the male line in 1740. The house also produced kings of Bohemia, Hungary, Croatia, Galicia, Portugal and Spain with their respective colonies, as well as rulers of several principalities in the Netherlands and Italy. From the 16th century, following the reign of Charles V, the dynasty was split between its Austrian and Spanish branches. Although they ruled distinct territories, they nevertheless maintained close relations and frequently intermarried.</p>
